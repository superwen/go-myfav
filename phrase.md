- 人生是一场错过,愿你别蹉跎  
- 城市在下雨,而我在想你  
- 俗事难料 舒眉一笑,管他世情如浪潮  
- 等一杯山色煮烟雨 再叙  
- 众里寻他千百度 那人已在灯火阑珊处  
- 青春岂不惜 行乐非所欲  
- We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars
- A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you
- Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change
- We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are
